The Xii-Boy Pocket is a small portable Wii using a Game Boy form factor. The Xii-Boy Pocket is the second version of my Xii-Boy design.
This new portable Wii is now better, thinner, and above all, Open-Source ! Compared to the Gboy Rev III, it is 25% smaller and 5mm thinner !

If you want to learn more about it, you can check this Bitbuilt Thread: Not yet, will be here soon 😉

⚠ NOTE: For the batteries, I personnaly order mine through [Akkuteile](https://akkuteile.de/). However, if you don't live in Europe, you should buy your batteries somewhere else.
You just have to order two 18650 batteries. You shouldn't order them through Aliexpress, they could be fake and maybe dangerous ⚠

The Xii-Boy Pocket's PCBs need specific settings to work properly:
