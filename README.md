The Xii-Boy Pocket is a small portable Wii using a Game Boy form factor. The Xii-Boy Pocket is the second version of my Xii-Boy design.
This new portable Wii is now better, thinner, and above all, Open-Source ! Compared to the Gboy Rev III, it is 25% smaller and 5mm thinner !

If you want to learn more about it, you can check this Bitbuilt Thread: Not yet, will be here soon üòâ

# Parts
All the parts you need to assemble a Xii-Boy Pocket are listed in the [Xii-Boy V2 Parts list](https://github.com/Xenii1642/Xii-Boy-Pocket/blob/main/Xii-Boy%20V2%20Parts%20List.pdf)

‚ö† NOTE: For the batteries, I personnaly order mine through [Akkuteile](https://akkuteile.de/). However, if you don't live in Europe, you should buy your batteries somewhere else.
You just have to order two 18650 batteries. You shouldn't order them through Aliexpress, they could be fake and maybe dangerous ‚ö†

# PCB
All the Gerbers you need for the Xii-Boy Pocket are available in the [Gerber Folder](https://github.com/Xenii1642/Xii-Boy-Pocket/tree/main/PCB%20Files/Gerber).

All the needed components are listed in the [Xii-Boy V2 PCB BOM.pdf](https://github.com/Xenii1642/Xii-Boy-Pocket/blob/main/Xii-Boy%20V2%20PCB%20BOM.pdf) file.

The Xii-Boy Pocket's PCBs need specific settings to work properly:

### **Controller PCB**:
- ENIG surface finish 
  
### **Xii-Flex**:
- 0.12mm thickness
- Stiffener Polyimide 0.2 mm
  
### **Main PCB**:

The other PCBs doens't need specific settings. You can just let the setting by defaul üëç
