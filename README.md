# Parts
All the parts you need to assemble a Xii-Boy Pocket are listed in the [Xii-Boy V2 Parts list](https://github.com/Xenii1642/Xii-Boy-Pocket/blob/main/Xii-Boy%20V2%20Parts%20List.pdf)

‚ö† NOTE: For the batteries, I personnaly order mine through [Akkuteile](https://akkuteile.de/). However, if you don't live in Europe, you should buy your batteries somewhere else.
You just have to order two 18650 batteries. You shouldn't order them through Aliexpress, they could be fake and maybe dangerous ‚ö†

# PCB

All the needed components are listed in the [Xii-Boy V2 PCB BOM.pdf](https://github.com/Xenii1642/Xii-Boy-Pocket/blob/main/Xii-Boy%20V2%20PCB%20BOM.pdf) file.

The Xii-Boy Pocket's PCBs need specific settings to work properly:

### **Controller PCB**:

The other PCBs doens't need specific settings. You can just let the setting by defaul üëç
